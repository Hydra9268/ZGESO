# Development Guide

### ZGESO Version Breakdown

For example, 949

* `949` = Community version based on the total number of Github commits (This is the version number on the ESOUI website)

----

### Development HOW-TO


`goto wailingprison4_base 50.00,50.00`
* `goto` = Tells the arrow where to point. Auto-advances to the next step if nothing but goto and step exist.
* `wailingprison4_base` = the current map's DDS reference. It only works when the user is in the zone.
* `50.00,50.00` = the floating-point x and y coordinates. Decimal values are optional but highly recommended for precision.
* Tip: Once the map's DDS is declared, you can exclude it in subsequent steps as long as the player stays in that zone. (e.g., `goto 50.00,50.00`)

#### These actions auto-advance to the next step

`accept` = Accept quests.<br/>
`turnin` = Turn in quests.<br/>
`wayshrine` = Discover wayshrines.<br/>
`step` = Declares a guide step (Auto-advance based on `goto` and `step` or if the condition of another action like wayshrine or accept is met).<br/>


#### These actions are purely visual and do not auto-advance to the next step

`talk` = Talk to NPCs.<br/>
`click` = Clicking objects and doors.<br/>
`'` = Adds general information.<br/>


#### ZGESO Functions of note

`ZGV.Utils.IsIntroTutorial()` = (functions.lua) Quickly indentifies the intro tutorial for new players. Currently configured for the Isle of Balfiera.


#### Goal Handlers - requires a pipe | in front to activate (e.g. |tip, |q, |count)

`|q` = Creates a step in ZGESO's progress bar. It also denotes the current step's quest.

`/` = Placed on the same line after `|q`. The slash checks for a completed task in the Quest Journal for the current step's quest. Important: Must match the task word-for-word, space-for-space to register as completed.

`|tip` = Handler for displaying tips in a small font. Note: placing a `|tip` in a `goto` step prevents the action from automatically going to the next step when meeting the condition.

`|next Aldmeri Dominion Leveling Guides\\Khenarthi's Roost` = Instructs ZGESO to go to another guide
* `next` = Handler that tells the guide to load another guide
* `Aldmeri Dominion Leveling Guides\\Khenarthi's Roost` = the RegisterGuide to load

`|count #` = Handler to track a sequence of objectives

For Example:
`|q The Waking Darkness/.*Cleanse the Mausoleums.* |count 2`
* `q` Quest tracking
* `The Waking Darkness` Name of quest
* `/.*Cleanse the Mausoleums.*` Quest objective (Formatting required `/.*Name of Objectve.*`)
* `|count 2` Current objective number

`|only if` and `|only if not` = Conditional handlers

For example<br>
`|only if ZGV.Utils.GetPlayerPreciseLevel() < 6 and _G.GetCurrentMapZoneIndex() == 712`<br>
Only allow this step if the player's precise level is less than 6 and the current map zone ID equals 712 (Northern Elsweyr)

`|only if not ZGV.QuestTracker:IsQuestComplete("A City in Black")`<br>
Only allow this step if the player hasn't completed the quest.

`|only if not ZGV.Quests:HasQuest("A City in Black") or ZGV.Quests:IsQuestComplete("A City in Black")`<br>
Only allow this step if the player doesn't have the quest or hasn't completed the quest.

`|only if ZGV.Utils.GetFaction("player","notvet")=="EP"`<br>
Only allow this step if the player's faction is Ebonheart Pact.

`|only if ZGV.Utils.GetFaction("player","notvet")=="AD"`<br>
Only allow this step if the player's faction is Aldmeri Dominion.

`|only if ZGV.Utils.GetFaction("player","notvet")=="DC"`<br>
Only allow this step if the player's faction is Daggerfall Covenant.

`|only not ZGV.Quests:HasQuest("A City in Black")`<br>
It appears to be the best method for accepting quests. `|only if not` causes the step to stick after accepting the quest.

`|only ZGV.Quests:HasQuest("A City in Black")`<br>
It appears to be the best method for quest steps. `|only if` causes the step to stick after accepting the quest.

`|or` = Handler for dialog choices. Important: You need to put the |or handler on each selection.

For example<br>
```
'Choose either a Marine or Wizard to help you
|tip It doesn't matter, just personal preference.
'Talk to either _Sergeant Firion_ or _Gathwen_
'Choose the Marine to help you |q The Tempest Unleashed/The Marine |or
'_OR_
'Choose the Wizard to help you |q The Tempest Unleashed/The Wizard |or
step
```

*To see a complete list of Types and Handlers, review Goal.lua. If you have questions, feel free to ask.*

### Slash commands

* `/re` = /reloadui
* `/zgpos` - For city and delve data. Also displays the map's correct DDS filename.
* `/zgpos gps` - For general map data. Works in any map.
* `/dump ZGFunctionName(arguments)` - A way to execute ESO's and ZGESO's public functions<br> (e.g. `/dump ZGV.Pointer:GetDistToCoords(alinor_base,48.80,54.64)`)

#### /dump functions of note:

* `/dump ZGV.Data:GetQuestIdByName("A City in Black")` - Returns the Quest ID
* `/dump ZGV.Quests:IsQuestComplete("A City in Black")` - Returns a boolean
* `/dump ZGV.Quests:HasQuest("A City in Black")` - Returns a boolean
* `/dump d(GetCurrentMapIndex())` - Returns the zone's ID. Tip: some functions require the `d()` command to display the output.
